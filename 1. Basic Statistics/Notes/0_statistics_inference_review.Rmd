## Using boxplots in R

We will be using the sleep dataset for this exmaple.

```{r}
plot(extra~group, data=sleep, main='Extra Sleep in Gosset Data by Group')
attach(sleep)  # allow using "sleep.extra" as "extra"
extra.1 = extra[group == 1]
extra.2 = extra[group == 2]
```


It seems that the second group has a clearly higher median. Let's tets the Hypothesis.


# Hypothesis testing


The hypothesis here are:

- $H_0$: mean response same for both drugs.

$$H_0: \mu_{drug_1}  \mu_{drug_2} \equiv \mu_{diff} = 0$$

- $H_1$: mean response is not the same for both drugs.

$$H_1: \mu_{drug_1}  \mu_{drug_2} \equiv \mu_{diff} \neq 0$$

```{r}
t.test(extra.1, extra.2, paired=TRUE, alternative="two.sided")
```

  - Use paired=TRUE when the same item/group is tested twice.
  - Use two-sided, as we assume there is no evidence one behaves better than the other.
  
**Note that the t-test assumes the differende between groups is normally distributed.**

Results show:

  - $t$ statistic: $-4.06$ (robust value).
  
  - $df$ (i.e. degrees of freedom): 9 (i.e. $participants - 1$).
  
  - $p_{value}$ is $0.0028$ (i.e. less than typical $\alpha$).
  
  - We can reject $H_0$.

Descriptions:

- $\alpha$ is the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis **(Type I error)**. It is typicall set to $0.05$ or $0.01$.

- $p_{value}$ is the likelihood of seeing the data under the null hypothesis. 

- $t$ statistic is computed as:

  $$t = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}$$
  
  where:
    - $\bar{d}$ is the difference between the means of the groups. We compare it with the null hypothesi value of the difference being 0 (i.e. $\bar{d} - 0$).
    - $s_d$ is the standard deviation of the differences (i.e. `sd(extra-1 - extra.2)`).
    - $n$ is the sample size.
    - Denominator gives a measure of variability.


Confidence interval of where the actual mean difference should be:

  $$Form: estimate \pm tableValue * estimatedStandardError$$

So, in the example:

  $$\bar{d} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \ s_d/\sqrt{n}$$

where:

  - $estimatedStandardError = stdOfDifference / \sqrt{n}$
  
  - Estimate is the computed mean difference.
  
  - $tableValue$ is the $t$ statistic at $\alpha/2$ (i.e. two-sided test). This value can be obtained in R as: `qt(x=0.975, df=9)`.


## Hypothesis test framework

  1. State null and alternatiev hypothesis.
  1. Clearly define terms (i.e. variables).
  1. Decide upon a significance level $\alpha$.
  1. Compute a test statistic (e.g. $z$, $t$, $\chi^2$, $F$).
  1. Find $p_{value}$ for the corresponding statistic (i.e. left, right or two-sided).
  1. Conclusion: Reject or do not reject (i.e. usually we do not "accept") $H_0$ according to $p_{value}$ and $\alpha$.
